        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are dedicated to reducing textile waste by encouraging communities to recycle and repurpose their unwanted clothes. Our mission is to make recycling accessible by setting up convenient drop boxes in public areas where people can easily donate their used clothes. These items are then repurposed into valuable products, such as recyclable pillows and other sustainable goods. By participating in our program, you contribute to a greener planet and help reduce the environmental impact of textile waste.</p>

        <h2>Our Recycling Process</h2>
        <p>We follow a streamlined process to turn waste into wonderful, reusable products. Our steps include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>  Collection:   We gather used clothes and textiles from our strategically placed drop boxes.</li>
            <li>  Sorting:   Items are sorted based on quality, fabric type, and potential for reuse.</li>
            <li>  Recycling:   Clothes that can’t be reused directly are processed into new materials, such as filling for recyclable pillows.</li>
            <li>  Distribution:   Finished products are distributed through various channels, including donations to shelters and sales in eco-friendly stores.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your contributions not only reduce landfill waste but also support communities in need. Together, we can make a tangible impact on our environment!</p>
